                    The peripheral devices are the main vehicle for obtaining
                    the benefits from the system since they are responsible for
                    the input/output (I/O) and for connecting the system to the
                    outside world. Some devices have a dual role, such as mass
                    storage, networks, and so onâ€”these are both I/O devices. In
                    general, these peripheral devices can be divided into the

                        the I/O transfer. Then, it returns to its previous
                        processing task. Interrupts require CPU immediate
                        attention (e.g., keyboard input, power failure,

                      <b>Direct Memory Access (DMA) -</b> It is a technique of
                      removing the CPU from the path and letting the peripheral
                      devices manage the memory buses directly to improve the
                      speed of transfer. A DMA controller manages the transfer
                      of data between peripherals and memory unit. Much hardware
                      systems use DMA, such as disk drive controllers, graphic
                      cards, network cards, sound cards, etc.

                    <p>
                      In DMA, the CPU initiates the transfer, does other
                      operations while the transfer is in progress, and receives
                      an interrupt from the DMA controller when the transfer has
                      been completed.
